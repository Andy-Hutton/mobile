        <h2>Theo Hutton</h2>
        <p>
          Theo is aged 5 years old and lives in West Kirby on the Wirral. Theo was
          starved of oxygen needing over seven minutes resuscitation and suffered a
          severe brain injury resulting in quadriplegic cerebral palsy. We want to
          help Theo reach his full potential and have an amazing quality of life by
          raising funds for life changing stem cell treatment and specialised
          equipment outside of the NHS, including intensive hyperbaric oxygen
          treatment. Theo is the biggest fighter we know with every little thing he
          does being a challenge. He has the biggest smile and is the happiest
          little boy who deserves a chance of the life he can enjoy just like
          everybody else. There are numerous therapies and pioneering treatments
          available, but they are not accessible on the NHS and the expense is very
          high. Not only will Theo need this treatment, he will also need specialist
          equipment. This is why we as Theo's parents and family want to launch
          'Theo's Fight' Campaign.      
        </p>
